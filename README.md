Hello, This is the front end Repo for How Many Meeples, an app for logging plays
of your favorite board games.  The app will let users define games and log, view,
and update play sessions of them by contacting a rails API.  I started this
project by creating and testing my back end tables, and then creating the routes
to access them through the browser.  I never hit any insurmountable problems,
but I did have to reign my project back because of time requirements - I was not
able to do as much data manipulation with my project as I would have liked.

My original user stories and wireframes can be found here:
